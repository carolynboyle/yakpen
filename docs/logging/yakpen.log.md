# Yakpen Log

Manual task tracking to discover how work actually flows.

## How to Use

Build a tree as you work. Indent to show what spawned from what.

**Verbs (state markers):**
- `Goal:` - What you set out to do
- `Active:` - What you're doing right now
- `Spawned:` - New task that emerged from current work
- `Obstructed:` - Blocked by something
- `Resolved:` - Done ✓
- `Parked:` - Set aside deliberately
- `Loop:` - Back here again
- `Woke:` - Dormant task just became relevant
- `Lost:` - No idea why I'm here

**Annotations (inline, optional):**
- `(URGENT)` - needs attention
- `(waiting)` - blocked on external
- `(dormant)` - might matter later
- `✓` - completed

**Format:**
```
Goal: The thing you meant to do
    └─ Spawned: First yak
        └─ Obstructed: Why you can't finish the yak
            └─ Spawned: The yak's yak
                └─ Resolved: Fixed it ✓
            └─ Active: Back to the obstruction
```

Keep it loose. The voice should be yours, not ticket-speak.
