    <h1>Why the Yak Had to Be Shaved<br>So the Code Could Be Shipped</h1>

    <p>A developer wanted to ship his code.<br>
    But to ship the code, he needed a code review.<br>
    To get the code review, he needed George to log in.<br>
    To log in, George needed his laptop unlocked.<br>
    To unlock the laptop, IT needed to reset his password.<br>
    To reset the password, they needed Sarah in Support.<br>
    But Sarah was stuck at home, waiting on her dad John.<br>
    And John couldn’t leave until he finished buying a yak-hair carpet.<br>
    Which meant—before anyone could review the code—someone had to go shave a yak.</p>

    <p><strong>That’s yak-shaving:</strong><br>
    the chain of unexpected tasks you must handle before you can do the actual task you started with.</p>

    <p>In technical work—coding, sysadmin, devops, homelabs—<br>
    you start with a simple goal, follow the thread,<br>
    and suddenly you’re fixing three systems you never meant to touch.</p>

    <p><strong>Yak-shaving isn’t the distraction.<br>
    It’s the real shape of the work.</strong></p>

    <p>And that is why the Yak Pen exists:<br>
    to map the messy, swirling, sideways path from<br>
    <em>“I just need to ship this code”</em> to<br>
    <em>“…okay, fine, hand me the clippers.”</em></p>
